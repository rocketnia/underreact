<h3>Canvas cursor demo (hand-rolled)</h3>
<p>Compare this to the <a href="canvas.html">Underreact
  version</a>.</p>
<p>Ideally, both versions will keep the white box precisely under the
  mouse cursor at all times. Unfortunately, JavaScript events take
  some time to make it through the event queue, so both versions have
  some noticeable lag.</p>
